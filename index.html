			<p>A saber-toothed cat (alternatively spelled sabre-toothed cat)[1] is any member of various extinct groups of predatory mammals that were characterized by long, curved saber-shaped canine teeth. The large maxillary canine teeth extended from the mouth even when it was closed. The saber-toothed cats were found worldwide from the Eocene epoch to the end of the Pleistocene epoch, existing for about 42 million years.</p>
			<h2>APPERANCE</h2>
			<p>Although these cats are only a bit smaller than panthers in size, they can weigh 
between 350 through 620 pounds and grow up to 15 feet in length. Saber tooth
 cats have short, bobbed tails, muscular necks, and long, dagger-like canine teeth
 that can grow up to 11 inches long, completely protruding over the lower jaw. Their
 jaws, unable to pierce bones, can, however, open up to 120 degrees. As cats, they
 had the ability to retract their claws. Their backs sloped downwards, similar of that to a
 hyena's. Their build was muscular, with longer back legs than those in the 
front.</p>
			<h3>HABITAT</h3>
			Saber-tooth cats lived in grasslands, shrubby areas, and pine forests that supported the plant-eating animals that saber-tooth cats ate. Smilodon was a carnivore, a meat-eater. This ferocious hunter may have eaten thick-skinned prey like mastodons (hairy, extinct elephants), horses, and bison.
			<h4> MATING HABITS  </h4>
			Nobody can know how the Smilodon reproduced because the animal is extinct but it can be assumed that it reproduced like any other large cat. Sexual reproduction and live birth are the only things that are assumed on reproduction for a saber-toothed cat.
